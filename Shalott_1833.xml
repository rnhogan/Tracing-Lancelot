				<head type="title">The Lady of Shallot</head>
				<byline/>
				by <persName>Alfred, Lord Tennyson</persName>
				<div type="part">
					<head type="title">Part the First.</head>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l>On either side the river lie</l>
					<l>Long fields of barley and of rye,</l>
					<l>That clothe the wold and meet the sky.</l>
					<l>And thro' the field the road runs by</l>
					<l>                To manytowered Camelot.</l>
					<l>The yellowleavèd waterlily,</l>
					<l>The greensheathèd daffodilly,</l>
					<l>Tremble in the water chilly,</l>
					<l>               Round about Shalott.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l>Willows whiten, aspens shiver,</l>
					<l>The sunbeam-showers break and quiver</l>
					<l>In the stream that runneth ever</l>
					<l>By the island in the river,</l>
					<l>               Flowing down to Camelot.</l>
					<l>Four gray walls and four gray towers</l>
					<l>Overlook a space of flowers,</l>
					<l>And the silent isle imbowers</l>
					<l>               The Lady of Shalott.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l>Underneath the bearded barley,</l>
					<l>The reaper, reaping late and early,</l>
					<l>Hears her ever chanting cheerly,</l>
					<l>Like an angel, singing clearly,</l>
					<l>               O'er the stream of Camelot.</l>
					<l>Piling the sheaves in furrows airy,</l>
					<l>Beneath the moon, the reaper weary</l>
					<l>Listening whispers, "'tis the fairy</l>
					<l>               Lady of Shalott."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>The little isle is all inrailed</l>
					<l>With a rose-fence, and overtrailed</l>
					<l>With roses: by the marge unhailed</l>
					<l>The shallop flitteth silkensailed,</l>
					<l>               Skimming down to Camelot.</l>
					<l>A pearlgarland winds her head:</l>
					<l>She leaneth on a velvet bed,</l>
					<l>Full royally apparellèd</l>
					<l>                The Lady of Shalott.</l>
				</lg>
			</div>
						<l>Part the Second.</l>
						<l>No time hath she to sport and play:</l>
						<l>A charmèd web she weaves alway.</l>
						<l>A curse is on her, if she stay</l>
						<l>Her weaving, either night or day,</l>
						<l>              To look down to Camelot.</l>
						<l>She knows not what the curse may be;</l>
						<l>Therefore she weaveth steadily,</l>
						<l>Therefore no other care hath she,</l>
						<l>              The Lady of Shalott.</l>
						<l>She lives with little joy or fear.</l>
						<l>Over the water, running near,</l>
						<l>The sheepbell tinkles in her ear.</l>
						<l>Before her hangs a mirror clear,</l>
						<l>              Reflecting towered Camelot.</l>
						<l>And, as the mazy web she whirls,</l>
						<l>She sees the surly village-churls,</l>
						<l>And the red cloaks of market-girls,</l>
						<l>              Pass onward from Shalott.</l>
						<l>Sometimes a troop of damsels glad,</l>
						<l>An abbot on an ambling pad,</l>
						<l>Sometimes a curly shepherd lad,</l>
						<l>Or longhaired page, in crimson clad,</l>
						<l>              Goes by to towered Camelot.</l>
						<l>And sometimes thro' the mirror blue,</l>
						<l>The knights come riding, two and two.</l>
						<l>She hath no loyal knight and true</l>
						<l>              The Lady of Shalott.</l>
						<l>But in her web she still delights</l>
						<l>To weave the mirror's magic sights:</l>
						<l>For often thro' the silent nights</l>
						<l>A funeral, with plumes and lights</l>
						<l>              And music, came from Camelot.</l>
						<l>Or, when the moon was overhead,</l>
						<l>Came two young lovers, lately wed:</l>
						<l>"I am half-sick of shadows," said</l>
						<l>              The Lady of Shalott.</l>
						<l>Part the Third.</l>
						<l>A bowshot from her bower-eaves.</l>
						<l>He rode between the barleysheaves:</l>
						<l>The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves,</l>
						<l>And flamed upon the brazen greaves</l>
						<l>              Of bold Sir Launcelot.</l>
						<l>A redcross knight for ever kneeled</l>
						<l>To a lady in his shield,</l>
						<l>That sparkled on the yellow field,</l>
						<l>              Beside remote Shalott.</l>
						<l>The gemmy bridle glittered free,</l>
						<l>Like to some branch of stars we see</l>
						<l>Hung in the golden galaxy.</l>
						<l>The bridle-bells rang merrily,</l>
						<l>              As he rode down from Camelot.</l>
						<l>And, from his blazoned baldric slung,</l>
						<l>A mighty silver bugle hung,</l>
						<l>And, as he rode, his armour rung,</l>
						<l>              Beside remote Shalott.</l>
						<l>All in the blue unclouded weather,</l>
						<l>Thickjewelled shone the saddle-leather.</l>
						<l>The helmet, and the helmet-feather</l>
						<l>Burned like one burning flame together,</l>
						<l>              As he rode down from Camelot.</l>
						<l>As often thro' the purple night,</l>
						<l>Below the starry clusters bright,</l>
						<l>Some bearded meteor, trailing light,</l>
						<l>              Moves over green Shalott.</l>
						<l>His broad clear brow in sunlight glowed.</l>
						<l>On burnished hooves his warhorse trode.</l>
						<l>From underneath his helmet flowed</l>
						<l>His coalblack curls, as on he rode,</l>
						<l>              As he rode down from Camelot.</l>
						<l>From the bank, and from the river,</l>
						<l>He flashed into the crystal mirror,</l>
						<l>"Tirra lirra, tirra lirra,"</l>
						<l>              Sang Sir Launcelot.</l>
						<l>She left the web: she left the loom:</l>
						<l>She made three paces thro' the room:</l>
						<l>She saw the waterflower bloom:</l>
						<l>She saw the helmet and the plume:</l>
						<l>              She looked down to Camelot.</l>
						<l>Out flew the web, and floated wide,</l>
						<l>The mirror cracked from side to side,</l>
						<l>'The curse is come upon me," cried</l>
						<l>              The Lady of Shalott.</l>
						<l>Part the Fourth.</l>
						<l>In the stormy eastwind straining</l>
						<l>The pale-yellow woods were waning,</l>
						<l>The broad stream in his banks complaining,</l>
						<l>Heavily the low sky raining</l>
						<l>              Over towered Camelot:</l>
						<l>Outside the isle a shallow boat</l>
						<l>Beneath a willow lay afloat,</l>
						<l>Below the carven stern she wrote,</l>
						<l>              THE LADY OF SHALOTT.</l>
						<l>A cloudwhite crown of pearl she dight.</l>
						<l>All raimented in snowy white</l>
						<l>That loosely flew, (her zone in sight,</l>
						<l>Clasped with one blinding diamond bright,)</l>
						<l>              Her wide eyes fixed on Camelot,</l>
						<l>Though the squally eastwind keenly</l>
						<l>Blew, with folded arms serenely</l>
						<l>By the water stood the queenly</l>
						<l>               Lady of Shalott.</l>
						<l>With a steady, stony glance—</l>
						<l>Like some bold seer in a trance,</l>
						<l>Beholding all his own mischance,</l>
						<l>Mute, with a glassy countenance—</l>
						<l>              She looked down to Camelot.</l>
						<l>It was the closing of the day,</l>
						<l>She loosed the chain, and down she lay,</l>
						<l>The broad stream bore her far away,</l>
						<l>              The Lady of Shalott.</l>
						<l>As when to sailors while they roam,</l>
						<l>By creeks and outfalls far from home,</l>
						<l>Rising and dropping with the foam,</l>
						<l>From dying swans wild warblings come,</l>
						<l>              Blown shoreward; so to Camelot</l>
						<l>Still as the boathead wound along</l>
						<l>The willowy hills and fields among,</l>
						<l>They heard her chanting her deathsong,</l>
						<l>              The Lady of Shalott.</l>
						<l>A longdrawn carol, mournful, holy,</l>
						<l>She chanted loudly, chanted lowly,</l>
						<l>Till her eyes were darkened wholly,</l>
						<l>And her smooth face sharpened slowly</l>
						<l>              Turned to towered Camelot:</l>
						<l>For ere she reached upon the tide</l>
						<l>The first house by the waterside,</l>
						<l>Singing in her song she died,</l>
						<l>              The Lady of Shalott.</l>
						<l>Under tower and balcony,</l>
						<l>By gardenwall and gallery,</l>
						<l>A pale, pale corpse she floated by,</l>
						<l>Deadcold, between the houses high,</l>
						<l>              Dead into towered Camelot.</l>
						<l>Knight and burgher, lord and dame,</l>
						<l>To the plankèd wharfage came:</l>
						<l>Below the stern they read her name,</l>
						<l>              "The Lady of Shalott."</l>
						<l>They crossed themselves, their stars they blest,</l>
						<l>Knight, minstrel, abbot, squire and guest.</l>
						<l>There lay a parchment on her breast,</l>
						<l>That puzzled more than all the rest,</l>
						<l>              The wellfed wits at Camelot.</l>
						<l>"The web was woven curiously</l>
						<l> The charm is broken utterly,</l>
						<l> Draw near and fear not – this is I,</l>
						<l>              The Lady of Shalott.</l>
